1. weather info for current location will be automatically updated.
2. Initial update may take little more time. 
3. if the city is added through the search box, the cardview for the added city can be removed later. But default city's card view cannot be removed.
4. to save the recent successful search result, auto complete text view is used. The city name is saved at shared preferences, only if the search was successful.
